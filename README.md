# **Election Analysis Challenge**
## **Overview of Election Audit**
The purpose of this analysis was to perform an audit of the results of a congressional election in the state of Colorado. The Colorado Board of Elections requested an analysis to be performed to be able to view the results of the election. The data was provided in a .CSV file and the following was required: 
* Total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* Total number of votes each candidate received
* Percentage of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote

In addition to the above requirements we were tasked to expand the analysis to include:

* The voter turnout for each county
* The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
* The county with the highest turnout
